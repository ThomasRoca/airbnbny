Notes on Airbnb business in New York
====================================

As described at http://tomslee.net/2013/10/notes-on-airbnbs-new-york-business.html
and at http://tomslee.net/2013/11/airbnb-business-in-new-york-revisited.html.

airbnb.py is the python script I used. It probably does not work any more
because Airbnb changed their search pages. I need to see if I can fix it up to
work with the new ones.

airbnb.db3 is the data. Everything is in the table room. There is a view nyroom
that shows only those rooms in New York. There is a view nyhost which provides
an alternative view into New York rooms.
